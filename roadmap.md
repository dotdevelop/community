# Roadmap

## Get it compile

First task is to get it compile again without closed repositories, 
as eveything is cluttered with MacOs / Cocoa code, remove / move that code

### Provide substitution for VS-Editor-Api

As VS-Editor-Api is deeply integrated in the code, provide a VS-Editor-Api based on Xwt / Gtk.
In the first step, this is not intended to be a WORKING VS-Editor-Api. It's just here to get MD compiling.

In a second step, there should be a discussion what concrete GUI-Framework is choosen as base for VS-Editor-Api
